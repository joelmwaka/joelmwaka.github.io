**Hobbies:**

- I dabble in football, basketball, and volleyball â€“ though, let's be honest, I'm not exactly the MVP in any of them.
- Occasional jogger. I ran my first half marathon in April 2023 (Aiming to run a full marathon before end of 2024).
- City trips. Europe is quite nicely connected, making weekend city trips a possibility.
- New passion for plants. Killed a few, but I won't give up yet.
