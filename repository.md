**Intrinsic Camera Calibration**

Camera calibration tool using OpenCV is a Python project designed to facilitate the calibration of cameras for computer 
vision applications. This tool leverages the OpenCV library to accurately determine intrinsic parameters such as focal 
length, principal point, and lens distortion.

**Automated Dataset Generation**

Generate a dataset to train computer vision neural networks like YOLO, FasterRCNN, etc. This tool works only for planar
objects like playing cards, road signs, etc. A demonstration of this tool is shown in the repository using road german 
"right-of-path" road signs.
