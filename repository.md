Below are links to my project repositories.

**Lightweight Multi-View 3D Pose Estimation through Camera-Disentangled Representation**

Tensorflow implementation of the canonical fusion model presented in the paper "Lightweight Multi-View 3D Pose Estimation through Camera-Disentangled Representation" by Remelli, et al.

**3D body pose estimation using MediaPipe in real time**

Some students in the lab needed 3D pose estimation. This is quite easy now with off the shelf body pose estimators. In this example, I show how to obtain 3D pose estimation using mediapipe.

**Calculating joint angles from 3D poses**

Joint angles are useful for retargeting body motion on a standard skeleton. This helps remove body proportion differences between motion capture subjects. In this demo, I show how to calculate joint angles from 3D body poses.

**Real time 3D hand pose esitmation using MediaPipe**

Demo showing how to obtain 3D hand pose using MediaPipe and two calibrated cameras in real time. We use this for robotic arm manipulation in our lab.

**Differentiable Direct Linear Transform**

Tensorflow implementation of differentiable direct linear transform, presented in the paper:
"Lightweight Multi-View 3D Pose Estimation through Camera-Disentangled Representation" by Remelli, et al.

**QR Code Orientation with OpenCV**  
Simple demo showing how to obtain position and orientation of QR code using OpenCV. We use this method in our lab to determine positions and orientations of objects in our Smart Workcell project.

**Python BVH Viewer**

A simple BVH file viewer written to use only python. Joint local and world space coordinates are calculated frame by frame so that they can be saved and used for other projects.
